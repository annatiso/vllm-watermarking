      "Generated text:  AI is intelligence applied to computers. By intelligence we mean the ability to “think.” By computers, we mean any machine that can be programmed to do something. The combination of intelligence and computers is the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Artificial intelligence has been with us for decades. In the 1960s, the first programs to find and solve chess problems were written. In the 1970s, early computer vision systems were developed to help find and recognize objects in images and videos. In the 1980s and 1990s, expert systems were developed that could mimic the reasoning skills of human experts in fields such as medicine and law. Today, AI has become a field of study in its own right, with researchers trying to understand the principles of intelligence and develop new computer programs that can perform tasks that would have been impossible for humans to do even a decade ago. AI has been used in a variety of ways, from helping doctors diagnose diseases to aiding robots in manufacturing plants. It has also been used to help make decisions in business and politics. What is AI? What is the history of AI? How does AI work? What are the benefits of AI? What are the drawbacks of AI? What is the future of AI? What is AI? AI\n"
